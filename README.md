# P2Tennis
Parsons Run Tennis league mananger

This application is based on Vaadin https://vaadin.com/

Its purpose is to manage multiple tennis leagues, keeping track of matches and scores.

It is a simple model (see P2TennisUML.jpg) to represent a Neighborhood that contains Leagues.   Each League has Teams (made up of 2 Players) and Rounds.   Each Round has a set of Matches.   

I used Vaddin Charts https://vaadin.com/charts to display the ELO scores for each team (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system)

I used the ImageStrip addon to create a slideshow: https://vaadin.com/directory#!addon/imagestrip
